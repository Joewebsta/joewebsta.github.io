            Overview
          .project-main
            %p.project-text
              I built Joeswebster.com to demonstrate to the world who I am and the UX work I&rsquo;m capable of. I treated the creation of my portfolio like any other project and applied the full UX design process.

            %p.project-text
              I collected portfolio tips from two hiring manager interviews and various website articles and then wrote them on individual post-it notes. I organized the notes into four themes: Info, Audience, My Work, and Design and referred to them several times throughout the UX process.

            %p.project-text
              In the process of researching portfolio best practices I was able to create a persona hypothesis. Doing so helped me better understand the perspective and needs of my primary persona: the busy hiring manager.

            %p.project-text
              A competitive analysis of other portfolios&rsquo; navigation elements helped me define my own. I tallied the frequency of nav elements from a handful of portfolios(1) and ordered them by total(2). I then explored different ways to say the most popular elements(3) and then selected my favorites(4).

              A user flow helped my better understand the path by which hiring managers and other users would navigate through and interact with my portfolio.

            %p.project-text
              As I entered the design phase I started with sketching. Using a few portfolio sites as inspiration I tested a number of potential layouts by concurrently sketching for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Below are sketches of the current website layout.

            %p.project-text
              Although my initial moodboard aided in defining my brand, it was too vague. I built upon my previous work by creating a style tile that defined my portfolio&rsquo;s typography, colors and general visual language.

            %p.project-text
              Sketched layouts and style tile complete, I combined the two deliverables to create Adobe Illustrator mockups. I prefer wrapping up the visual design prior to moving into development so that I can code independently of making design decisions.

              Once my website was deployed, I asked friends and family to test drive my site. I gained valuable feedback and incorporated it into the design of my portfolio.
