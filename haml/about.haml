              When I was a kid I would regularly rearrange the furniture in my bedroom. Some arrangements made great use of space and others were impractical. Either way, I had an affinity for considering a multitude of solutions to a problem, selecting one, testing it, experiencing it, noting what worked and then scrapping it before moving on to the next. In my youth I learned that there are multiple ways to solve a problem, but that some are more appropriate or efficient than others.

              As a UX Designer I bring the same curiosity and problem solving I possessed in my childhood to modern design challenges. There are many ways to solve digital usability issues, but there are some solutions that better serve the needs of both business and users. I strive to balance the intersection of stakeholder and user needs in such a way that time is optimized and not wasted for either party. Time is precious and better spent with whom and what you love.
